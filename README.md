# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, A talented developer is here

## About me

<h3>Previously I have worked as a full stack developer and have 8 years of experience in this role.

Over my early career I have had the fortune of working under brilliant team leads who have drilled into me the importance of clean, readable and
maintainable code.

I like to think of myself as framework agnostic and have strong enough fundamentals in basic web technologies that I can quickly adapt to whatever framework is needed (or lack thereof). I also care deeply about UI/UX and hope to create a more accessible web.

Currently I am focusing on expanding my skillset learning about Data Analytics and AI.</h3>

## Technology

<h3>I currently work with are React, Next.js, Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Node.js, Express.js, Svelte, SvelteKit, with either Javascript or Typescript.

I am also familiar with Python, Django, Flask, fast API TesnorFlow, Pytorch, Pandas, Jupyter Notebooks.

I have worked with cloud platforms include AWS and Azure, CICD pipelines, Cloudflare and Netlify.</h3>

ðŸš€ I am currently looking for remote work in a Software Engineering or Frontend Development roles.

ðŸ“– Interested in my writing?
